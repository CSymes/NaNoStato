# NaNoStato
Adds some extra stats to NaNoWriMo novel pages.

Currently adds an extra graph above the original two, showing words written per day on the novel you're looking at. An example of the script at work can be seen below. The top graph is the script's handiwork, inserted above the standard cumulative words graph that would normally display first.
