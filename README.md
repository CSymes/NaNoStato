# NaNoStato - Deprecated

**This project is now deprecated, as NaNoWriMo have updated their website design with better stat tools that mostly supercede what I had done here, so I'm not going to update it for the redesign**


Adds some extra stats to NaNoWriMo novel pages.

Currently adds an extra graph above the original two, showing words written per day on the novel you're looking at. An example of the script at work can be seen below. The top graph is the script's handiwork, inserted above the standard cumulative words graph that would normally display first.
